# Atlas Nerd Count

Atlas Nerd Count will show you a random percentage of nerd you are.
Nerd count will save a users nerd percentage, thankfully if you got 100% (what a fucking nerd am I right), someone can reset it for you.

# Setup

  - Import the action on the atlas dashboard.
  - Thats it.
  - You can view commands with a!nerd help.
# You can customize it
Don't like being called a nerd? Well you can be publically shamed for all types of things don't you worry. 
The bot is easy to customize, but you'll need knowledge of how Atlas actions work to do so.
# I made a random number generator
thats it. 
this whole thing could've been just:
```
a!eval {range;0;100}
```
